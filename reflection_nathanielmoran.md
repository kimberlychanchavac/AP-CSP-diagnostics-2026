1. The first thing I did when I opened this repository was read all the instructions and tasks, then created a fork accidently, not knowing that it was the correct first step unti someone told me so.
2. The most confusing part was figuring out which option to choose when commiting the changes.
3. Strategies I used when I got stuck was looking on the internet for assistance.
4. I read all the information just incase even if it didnt help me in any way.
5. I feel more confident in knowing how to make a copy of assignments, and how to create new files within those assignments.
6. Something that still feels unclear to me is why the used of .md is needed and what some of these other features on github are for.
